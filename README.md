Lumberjack
======

Adds lumberaxes made from normal all tool materials. (May or may not work with modded materials, depends on how good the other modder's integration is.)

Thanks to @mallrat208 for the initial 1.9.4 port!

If you see missing textures, feel free to make one and send it our way.

Due to Vanilla Limitationâ„¢ you can't really use MetaData based ingots in your repair materials, if you add them via D3Core's `materials.json` file. I suggest using Mine/Crafttweaker and you can't always use the anvil to repair (combine crafting only).
